# Tycoon-Widescreen-Patches

Collection of widescreen patches I have made for selected tycoon games. 

Each patch is located in [patches](patches/) directory of the repository, it replaces the default letterbox resolution (like 1280x960) with a widescreen one.

To run a patch, download the patch you need and put it in game's folder, open terminal and execute command, for instance, `python .\cruise_patch.py` (replace with whatever patch you want to run). 

By default, it will try to detect the resolution of your screen and match to that, but, if on **Linux**, you'll need to install the following pip package: `pip install pyautogui`.

Alternatively, you can try and define custom resolution and also path to game's exe like that: `python .\cruise_patch.py "path/to/the/game.exe" 1280x800`. Run `python .\cruise_patch.py -h` to see all possible arguments. To undo the patch, run `python .\cruise_patch.py -r` to restore the unpatched exe from the backup made during patch execution. 

Each game can have its own specifics or issues, which you can check in the table of patches below. First of all, there are often updates for these games online, try running updater that came with the game to update the game; or use the trusted sources (like this [Update 3](https://www.gamepressure.com/download.asp?ID=4128) for Cruise Ship Tycoon). These updates sometimes fix game crashing bugs, so my widescreen patches would often support only the latest version. I also try to eliminate all except the minor issues that arise from widescreen patches, so nothing game breaking (I hope). At the same time, while I tested the selected resolutions, and everything seems to work, I didn't test the games extensively. I also didn't test them under Wine (should work) or in multi-monitor configuration (you're welcome to try).

Also, look for table of examples for screenshots of the patched games in the 3 most common resolutions: 1280x800 (Steam Deck resolution), 1920x1080, 3840x2160 (4K).

## Acknowledgments

As many of the tycoon games, this project started with Roller Coaster Tycoon (1999). Specifically, with [jeFF0Falltrades](https://github.com/jeFF0Falltrades)'s [tutorial](https://youtu.be/cwBoUuy4nGc) on how to patch the game to support widescreen resolutions. You can also find his Python patch for the game [here](https://github.com/jeFF0Falltrades/Tutorials/tree/master/rct_full_res).

After watching the tutorial, I also remembered I played Cruise Ship Tycoon and similar tycoon games a while ago, hence my patches. At the same time, I didn't use the linked patch above in the writing of my patches. My mistakes are mine and mine alone. Well, mine and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)'s sometimes.

The tools I used: [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra), [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/), [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) hex editor, and a method of [trial and error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error).
